Introduction

Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are mostly obligate root symbionts of many tree species. They are important for the success of their hosts. EMF species pools are poorly resolved, but dispersal is important. In addition, some EMF are invasive.

Using imputed FIA data, we estimated landscape connectivity for a sample of better-characterised EMF taxa across the eastern US.
